Home Automation System Architecture
 . Overview
 This document outlines the system architecture for the home automation prototype,
 designed to control multiple devices such as lights and fans. The system will leverage
 MQTT as the primary communication protocol for its flexibility and scalability, allowing
 for seamless operation via a smartphone or web application.
 . Core Components
 The home automation system will consist of the following core components:
 IoT Devices (Lights, Fans): These are the physical devices equipped with
 microcontrollers (e.g., ESP /ESP
 ) and sensors/actuators to interact with
 the environment and receive commands.
 MQTT Broker: A central server that facilitates communication between IoT
 devices and the control application. It acts as a message hub, ensuring secure
 and efficient data exchange.
 Backend Server: A server-side application responsible for managing device
 states, user authentication, scheduling, and interacting with the MQTT broker. It
 will provide APIs for the frontend application.
 Frontend Application (Web/Mobile): The user interface for controlling devices,
 monitoring status, and setting up schedules. This can be a web application or a
 smartphone application.
 Database: Stores device configurations, user data, schedules, and historical
 sensor data.
. Communication Flow
 . Device to Broker: IoT devices publish their status (e.g., light on/off, fan speed) to
 specific MQTT topics on the broker.
 . Application to Broker: The frontend application sends commands (e.g., turn on
 light, set fan speed) to the backend server, which then publishes these
 commands to relevant MQTT topics.
 . Broker to Device: The MQTT broker forwards commands to the respective IoT
 devices subscribed to those topics.
 . Broker to Backend: The backend server subscribes to device status topics to
 maintain real-time device states.
 . Backend to Application: The backend server provides real-time device status
 updates to the frontend application via APIs (e.g., WebSockets).
 . Security Considerations
 Authentication: Secure user authentication for accessing the control
 application.
 Authorization: Role-based access control to ensure users can only control
 authorized devices.
 Encrypted Communication: Use TLS/SSL for secure communication between all
 components (devices, broker, backend, frontend).
 . Technology Stack (Proposed)
 IoT Devices: ESP /ESP 
with MicroPython or Arduino framework.
 MQTT Broker: Mosquitto (open-source).
 Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Node.js (Express).
 Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
 Frontend: React (Web) or React Native (Mobile).
